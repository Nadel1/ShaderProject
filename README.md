# ShaderProject
My goal for this project was to broaden my knowledge on Unity and teach myself to write shaders. Everything in this project is selfmade, including the models and animations. This made me face new difficulties, as I havenÂ´t dealt with selfmade animations or models before. I also learned how to write a grass, water and toon shader and how to combine all the elements in a  presentable way.

In order to try the final build, the whole build directory needs to be downloaded.
